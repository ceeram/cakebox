# Introduction

Simply put... we need your help to make this a success and would love to
see your ideas and contributions!

## Documentation

Help us improve this documentation by contributing Pull Requests that hold
changes to the Markdown (.md) files
located in your local ``cakebox/docs`` folder.

## Cakebox Console

Help us improve the Cakebox Dashboard and Console commands by
contributing Pull Requests to the [cakebox-console](https://github.com/alt3/cakebox-console)
project. It contains the CakePHP 3.x sources and could
probably do with a lot of improvements and refactoring. Don't hold back...
all help is welcomed!

## Cakebox Builder

The [cakebox-builder](https://github.com/alt3/cakebox-builder) project holds the
sources used to build the cakebox Vagrant box-image and will require some
knowledge of
[Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/), [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) and the
various [Cookbooks](https://github.com/alt3/cakebox-builder/blob/master/Berksfile).
Pull Requests for **new** functionality will always be discussed since we aim to
keep the number of major changes to the box-image to an absolute minimum.

## Compatibility Testing

We are curious to find out on which platforms the cakebox is being used and
runs on. Let us know if you have successfully completed the
[Creating Your First Website](tutorials/creating-your-first-website/)
tutorial and provide us with:

+ the Operating System and version you are using (e.g. Windows 8.1 or Ubuntu 14.04)
+ your version of VirtualBox
+ your version of Vagrant
+ the number of CPUs and amount of memory on your local machine
