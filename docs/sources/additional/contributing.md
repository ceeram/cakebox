The ``CakePHP 3.x`` sources for the Cakebox Commands and Dashboard
are found in the [cakebox-console](https://github.com/alt3/cakebox-console)
project and could do with a lot of improvement so don't hold back to
submit a PR:

## Cakebox Builder

The [cakebox-builder](https://github.com/alt3/cakebox-builder) project holds the
sources used to build the cakebox Vagrant box-image and will require some
knowledge of
[Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/), [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) and the
various [Cookbooks](https://github.com/alt3/cakebox-builder/blob/master/Berksfile).
Pull Requests for **new** functionality will always be discussed since we aim to
keep the number of major changes to the box-image to an absolute minimum.
